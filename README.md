# ADAPTIVE-LEARNING-SYSTEMS-AUTOMATIC-STUDENT-SEGMENTATION-BASED-ON-ONLINE-COURSE-INTERACTION
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an adaptive learning system that segments students based on their interactions with online course reviews. By leveraging machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP), the system provides personalized learning experiences, aiming to improve student engagement and learning outcomes.

Features
Student Segmentation: Implemented K-means clustering on preprocessed student interaction data, achieving a Silhouette Score of 0.5575, Calinski-Harabasz Index of 8.6742, and Davies-Bouldin Index of 0.6090.
Machine Learning Model: Developed and validated a machine learning model for adaptive learning systems, achieving an AUC score of 0.9216 and a mean cross-validation accuracy of 0.8675.
Performance Evaluation: Achieved a test set accuracy of 0.8550, with precision and recall scores of 0.80 and 0.91 for class 0, and 0.91 and 0.80 for class 1. Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix showing 85 true negatives, 8 false positives, 21 false negatives, and 86 true positives.
Dataset
The dataset contains Coursera reviews with the following columns:

reviews: The text of the review.
reviewers: The ID or name of the reviewer.
date_review: The date the review was posted.
rating: The rating given by the reviewer.
course_id: The ID of the course being reviewed.
Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and converted date formats.
Cleaned text data and performed sentiment analysis.
Feature Engineering:

Extracted features such as review length and sentiment score.
Aggregated review data for each reviewer.
Clustering for Student Segmentation:

Scaled features and applied K-means clustering.
Evaluated clustering using Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.
Machine Learning Model Development:

Developed a classification model and validated it using cross-validation.
Evaluated model performance using AUC score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
